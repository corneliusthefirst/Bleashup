//TODO: A;l Of These Issues below needs to be resovle by the completion of the feature reminds/tasks

[ ] Handle the error that occurs when one onpens the post list view from the changing image lists from on the public event card.
        - I don't yet know what causes the error but what i know is that it happens rarely .
        - While waiting to solve it i can only investigate.

[*] Handle the error of the Activity details page ever loading sometimes.
    - Sometimes, The spinner(loader) spines for ever. i don't yet know what causes it .
        i will only investigate while waiting to solve it .


[*] Handle The of the backPress sometimes not working .
    - This is due to some Modals which are listening to backPress, once opened will not 
        unregister its handle even when closed because it's not unmounted onClosed.

note that deleting recurrent event on ios will not work use instead removeFutureEvents from RNCalendarEvents instead of tradtional RemoveEvents. 
see: https://github.com/wmcmahan/react-native-calendar-events/issues/12
[ ] Handle Proper Date display on the Activity menu Public event card and invitation
     card in case the activity is a recursive one.

[*] Check if the user is a master before performing an update onLongPress on the Acivity Details page.

[*] implement a restore after deleting

[*] Check that A Post has atleat one of the inputs fields before accepting creation on the Activiy Details page.

[*] Add A BackPress handle on Create Activity page and on the mytask page.

[ ] On the likes module if the likes has never been initialized in the store, It will alway fetch likes 
    on Mount . But one The Likes is initialised in the store . it will never fetch again.
    From Then Likes will be updatable only through updatesDispatcher. 

    - This is a Good Practise in case the user is a member of the activity. since being a member
    implies having subscribed to all incomming updates on that activity. 

    - But in the case it a public Activity and the user has not yet joint, once it fetches the likes and 
        initialises the store for the first time, it will never fetch again and hence the likes of the
        likes for that activity on that device will remain outdated if any update occurs. 

    - This is highly problematic. 

    [*]  When a remind is added or deleted the whole list refreshes in the remind tab in the event page 

[*] implement daysOfWeek and WeekOfMonth in setting remind recurrence. 

[*] implement the configuratoins Who can add a post and who can add a remind.

[*] implement checking base on the conditions listed above . 

[ ] attarchement message ar not able to be opened after reopening the app after sending it .
    this is deu to a permission issues. i dought if this happens on all devices. but it 
    happened on my own. 

[ ] add likes to posts.
[ ] add and handle the concept of public and private post. 
[ ] make sound recorder as component so that it should be working for both message and reminds report. 
[ ] add recorder audio possibility to remind reports.
[ ] ensure realtimecity in all the sub components of all individual pages. 
    that is going to mark the difference as pro. 
[ ] handle updates of deleted functionalities . the application should be able to handle and 
    updates of deleted functionalities . like some create a vote while you where offline, he mad numerous 
    updates on it and later he deleted it while you where offline . 
    now you come online receive all the updates including the creation update . 
    the app should be able to handle that scenario . 

    the approach to solve this as follows, if a during fetching a functionlity , it does noted exist, 
    the app will store that functionlality with deleted information, like title:'deleted vote/remind/post',
    and providing deleted info for others . 
    so that when the updates related to that deleted features comes they should be handle without the app 
    crashing there by leting the current user to know that the functionlality was deleted . 
[ ] apply default date on the datime picker implemented on votes on all the other parts of the application 
    where date time pickers are used namely reminds settings and activity settings .

[] 
    A solution needs to implemented to handle this . 
    The same applies for sharers.
