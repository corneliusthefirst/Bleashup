//TODO: A;l Of These Issues below needs to be resovle by the completion of the feature reminds/tasks

[ ] Handle the error that occurs when one onpens the post list view from the changing image lists from on the public event card.
        - I don't yet know what causes the error but what i know is that it happens rarely .
        - While waiting to solve it i can only investigate.

[*] Handle the error of the Activity details page ever loading sometimes.
    - Sometimes, The spinner(loader) spines for ever. i don't yet know what causes it .
        i will only investigate while waiting to solve it .


[*] Handle The of the backPress sometimes not working .
    - This is due to some Modals which are listening to backPress, once opened will not 
        unregister its handle even when closed because it's not unmounted onClosed.


[ ] Handle Proper Date display on the Activity menu Public event card and invitation
     card in case the activity is a recursive one.

[*] Check if the user is a master before performing an update onLongPress on the Acivity Details page.

[*] implement a restore after deleting

[*] Check that A Post has atleat one of the inputs fields before accepting creation on the Activiy Details page.

[*] Add A BackPress handle on Create Activity page and on the mytask page.

[ ] On the likes module if the likes has never been initialized in the store, It will alway fetch likes 
    on Mount . But one The Likes is initialised in the store . it will never fetch again.
    From Then Likes will be updatable only through updatesDispatcher. 

    - This is a Good Practise in case the user is a member of the activity. since being a member
    implies having subscribed to all incomming updates on that activity. 

    - But in the case it a public Activity and the user has not yet joint, once it fetches the likes and 
        initialises the store for the first time, it will never fetch again and hence the likes of the
        likes for that activity on that device will remain outdated if any update occurs. 

    - This is highly problematic. 

    [*]  When a remind is added or deleted the whole list refreshes in the remind tab in the event page 

[] implement daysOfWeek and WeekOfMonth in setting remind recurrence. 

[] implement the configuratoins Who can add a post and who can add a remind.

[] implement checking base on the conditions listed above . 

[] 
    A solution needs to implemented to handle this . 
    The same applies for sharers.
